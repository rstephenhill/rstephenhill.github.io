Welcome! I’m Stephen Hill, Instructor of Latin at <a href="http://wyomingcatholic.edu/" target="_blank">Wyoming Catholic College</a> and Ph.D candidate in <a href="https://classics.as.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">Classics at the University of Virginia</a>. As a teacher, I help language learners develop fluency in reading, writing, and speaking ancient Greek and Latin through active communication, something I've done for over ten years. As a researcher, I investigate ancient Greek religion in the imperial period; my dissertation focuses on the figure of Heracles in Dio Chrysostom, Lucian, and Philostratus. I previously earned M.A. degrees in Classics (Kentucky) and Teaching English as a Second Language (Illinois).
