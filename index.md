Welcome! I’m Stephen Hill, Instructor of Latin at Wyoming Catholic College and Ph.D candidate in Classics at the University of Virginia. As a teacher, I help language learners develop fluency in reading, writing, and speaking ancient Greek and Latin through active communication. As a researcher, I investigate ancient Greek religion in the imperial period; my dissertation focuses on the figure of Heracles in Dio Chrysostom, Lucian, and Philostratus. This site is currently under construction. In the meantime, feel free to visit my <a href="https://virginia.academia.edu/RStephenHill" target="_blank">academia.edu</a> site or my <a href="https://wyomingcatholic.edu/person/stephen-hill/" target="_blank">faculty profile</a> at Wyoming Catholic College.
