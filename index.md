Welcome! I’m Stephen Hill, Instructor of Latin at <a href="http://wyomingcatholic.edu/" target="_blank">Wyoming Catholic College</a>. I recently defended my dissertation in the <a href="https://classics.as.virginia.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Classics at the University of Virginia</a>. For over a decade, I've helped language learners develop fluency in reading, writing, and speaking ancient Greek and Latin through active communication. My research interests include imperial Greek literature and culture, Greek religion, and the application of second language acquisition research to ancient language teaching. I previously earned M.A. degrees in Classics (Kentucky) and Teaching English as a Second Language (Illinois).
