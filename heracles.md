## 2: Lucian *Dream* 5
ἵνα γὰρ καθ’ Ὁμηρον εἴπω, "θεῖός μοι ἐνύπνιον ἦλθεν ὄνειρος / ἀμβροσίην διὰ νύκτα," **ἐναργὴς** οὔτως ὥστε μηδὲν ἀπολείπεσθαι τῆς ἀληθείας. ἔτι γοῦν καὶ μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον τά τε σχήματά μοι τῶν φανέντων ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς παραμένει καὶ ἡ φωνὴ τῶν ἀκουσθέντων **ἔναυλος**· οὕτω **σαφῆ** πάντα ἦν.

To speak after the manner of Homer, "A divine dream, a vision, came upon me in the ambrosial night," so **vivid** as to in no way fall short of the truth. For still, after so much time, the forms of what appeared to me remain in my eyes and the sound of what I heard is **distinct**, everything was so **clear**.


## 3: Lucian *Dream* 8
Ταῦτα καὶ ἔτι τούτων πλείονα διαπταίουσα καὶ βαρβαρίζουσα πάντοθεν εἶπεν ἡ Τέχνη . . . **ἀλλ’ οὐκέτι μέμνημαι· τὰ πλεῖστα γὰρ μου τὴν μνήμην ἤδη διέφυγεν.**

Sculpture said these things and even more than these, blundering and barbarizing at every turn . . . **but I don’t remember anymore. Most of what she said has already escaped my memory.**

## 4: Lucian *Dream* 15

ἀρθεὶς δὲ εἰς ὕψος ἐγὼ ἐπεσκόπουν ἀπὸ τῆς ἕω ἀρξάμενος ἄχρι πρὸς τὰ ἑσπέρια πόλεις καὶ ἔθνη καὶ δήμους, καθάπερ ὁ Τριπτόλεμος ἀποσπείρων τι εἰς τὴν γῆν. **οὐκέτι μέντοι μέμνημαι** ὅ τι τὸ σπειρόμενον ἐκεῖνο ἦν, πλὴν τοῦτο μόνον ὅτι κάτωθεν ἀφορῶντες ἄνθρωποι ἐπῄνουν . . .

Lifted up to a great height I looked from the east to the west and beheld cities and races and peoples, and like Triptolemus I was sowing something down to earth. **Yet I no longer remember** what it was that I was sowing, except only that the people looking at me from below approved of it . . .

## 5: Lucian *Dream* 16

Ταῦτα **μέμνημαι** ἰδὼν ἀντίπαις ἔτι ὤν, ἐμοὶ δοκεῖν ἐκταραχθεὶς πρὸς τὸν τῶν πληγῶν φόβον.

**I remember** seeing this when I was still a boy, greatly upset, I think, by my fear of [my uncle's] blows.

## 6: Ar. *Clouds* 483–85

ΣΩ. οὔκ, ἀλλὰ βραχέα σου πυθέσθαι βούλομαι.

ἦ **μνημονικὸς** εἶ; ΣΤ. δύο τρόπω νὴ τὸν Δία·

ἢν μὲν γὰρ ὀφείληταί τί μοι, **μνήμων** πάνυ·

ἐὰν δ᾽ ὀφείλω σχέτλιος, **ἐπιλήσμων** πάνυ.

Are you **apt to remember things**? By Zeus, in two ways: if something is owed me, I have an excellent **memory**; but if I'm the wretch who owes something, I'm quite **forgetful**.

## 7: Ar. *Clouds* 629–31

μὰ τὴν Ἀναπνοὴν μὰ τὸ Χάος μὰ τὸν Ἀέρα
	
οὐκ εἶδον οὕτως ἄνδρ᾽ ἄγροικον οὐδένα

οὐδ᾽ ἄπορον οὐδὲ σκαιὸν οὐδ᾽ **ἐπιλήσμονα**·
	
ὅστις σκαλαθυρμάτι᾽ ἄττα μικρὰ μανθάνων
	
ταῦτ᾽ **ἐπιλέλησται** πρὶν μαθεῖν . . . 

By Breath, by Chaos, by the Air, I have never seen a man so rustic, helpless, clumsy, or **forgetful**, who in learning a few worthless scraps **forgets** them before he's learned them!

## 8: Ar. *Clouds* 785–90

ΣΩ. ἀλλ᾽ εὐθὺς **ἐπιλήθει** σύ γ᾽ ἅττ᾽ ἂν καὶ μάθῃς· / ἐπεὶ τί νυνὶ πρῶτον ἐδιδάχθης; λέγε.
	
ΣΤ. φέρ᾽ ἴδω τί μέντοι πρῶτον ἦν; τί πρῶτον ἦν;
	
τίς ἦν ἐν ᾗ 'ματτόμεθα μέντοι τἄλφιτα;
	
οἴμοι τίς ἦν; ΣΩ. οὐκ ἐς κόρακας ἀποφθερεῖ,
	
**ἐπιλησμότατον** καὶ σκαιότατον γερόντιον;
	
Socrates: "But you immediately **forget** whatever you've learned! What were you taught just now? Say it." Strepsiades: "Let's see, what was first, then? What was first? What was it that we knead groats in? What was it?!" Socrates: "Damn you, you **exceedingly forgetful** and clumsy old man!"


## 9: Lucian *Dream* 12

ὁ δὲ Σωκράτης καὶ αὐτὸς ὑπὸ τῇ Ἑρμογλυφικῇ ταύτῃ τραφείς, ἐπειδὴ τάχιστα συνῆκε **τοῦ κρείττονος** καὶ δραπετεύσας παρ’ αὐτῆς **ηὐτομόλησεν** ὡς ἐμέ, ἀκούεις ὡς παρὰ πάντων ᾄδεται.

And Socrates, who himself was nurtured by this woman Sculpture, as soon as he understood **what was better**, he ran away from her and **deserted** to me–-and you know how he is celebrated by everyone.

## 10: Ar. *Clouds* 1104

ΚΡ. **ἐξαυτομολῶ** πρὸς ὑμᾶς.
		
Stronger Arg.: "**I'm deserting** to you."

## 11: Lucian *Dream* 17

Μεταξὺ δὲ λέγοντος, "**Ἡράκλεις**," ἔφη τις, "ὡς μακρὸν τὸ ἐνύπνιον καὶ δικανικὸν.» εἶτ’ ἄλλος ὑπέκρουσε, "Χειμερινὸς ὄνειρος, ὅτε μήκισταί εἰσιν αἱ νύκτες, ἢ τάχα που τριέσπερος, ὥσπερ **ὁ Ἡρακλῆς**, καὶ αὐτός ἐστι. . . . ἔωλος γὰρ ἡ ψυχρολογία. μὴ ὀνείρων ὑποκριτάς τινας ἡμᾶς ὑπείληφεν;" οὔκ, ὦγαθε· οὐδὲ γὰρ **ὁ Ξενοφῶν ποτε διηγούμενος τὸ ἐνύπνιον**, ὡς ἐδόκει αὐτῷ κεραυνὸς ἐμπεσὼν καίειν τὴν πατρῴαν οἰκίαν καὶ τὰ ἄλλα, — ἴστε γὰρ — οὐχ ὑπόκρισιν τὴν ὄψιν οὐδ’ ὡς φλυαρεῖν ἐγνωκὼς αὐτὰ διεξῄει . . . ἀλλά τι καὶ χρήσιμον εἶχεν ἡ διήγησις.

But as I was speaking, "**Heracles**!" someone said, "what a long and forensic dream."	Then someone else broke in: "A wintry dream, when the nights are longest, or perhaps he too was begotten in three nights, just like **Heracles**. . . . His nonsense is stale. Surely he doesn't take us for dream-interpreters?" No, my friend: for even **Xenophon, when he told how in a dream** it seemed to him that a thunderbolt struck and burned up his ancestral home and all the rest–-you know what I'm referring to–-he wasn't recounting all that in order to have it interpreted or because he'd decided to talk nonsense; . . . no, the story had something useful in it.


## 12: Ar. *Clouds* 43–48

ἐμοὶ γὰρ ἦν ἄγροικος **ἥδιστος** βίος
		
εὐρωτιῶν, ἀκόρητος, εἰκῇ κείμενος,
		
βρύων μελίτταις καὶ προβάτοις καὶ στεμφύλοις.
		
ἔπειτ᾽ ἔγημα Μεγακλέους τοῦ Μεγακλέους
		
ἀδελφιδῆν ἄγροικος ὢν ἐξ ἄστεως,
		
σεμνὴν **τρυφῶσαν** ἐγκεκοισυρωμένην.

Mine was an **exceedingly pleasant** rustic life: moldy, free of bugs, lying where I pleased, full of bees and sheep and olive-cakes. Then I, from the country, married the city-bred niece of Megacles son of Megacles; she was majestic, **luxurious**, Coisyracized.
		
## 13: Ar. *Clouds* 359–60

οὐ γὰρ ἄλλῳ γ' ὑπακούσαιμεν τῶν νῦν μετεωροσοφιστῶν / πλὴν ἢ **Προδίκῳ** . . .

  "For we would not listen to any other contemporary celestially minded sophist [than you, Socrates], except for Prodicus . . ."

## 14: Ar. *Clouds* 1048–50

ΗΤ. Καί μοι φράσον· τῶν τοῦ Διὸς παίδων τίν' ἄνδρ' ἄριστον
		
ψυχὴν νομίζεις, εἰπέ, καὶ πλείστους **πόνους πονῆσαι**;
		
ΚΡ. ἐγὼ μὲν οὐδέν' **Ἡρακλέους** βελτίον' ἄνδρα κρίνω.
		
Weaker Arg.: "Tell me: which one of Zeus' children do you think is most excellent in soul and completed the most **labors**?" Stronger Arg.: "For my part, I don't consider any man better than **Heracles**."
