# 2: Lucian *Dream* 5
ἵνα γὰρ καθ’ Ὁμηρον εἴπω, ``θεῖός μοι ἐνύπνιον ἦλθεν ὄνειρος / ἀμβροσίην διὰ νύκτα,'' **ἐναργὴς** οὔτως ὥστε μηδὲν ἀπολείπεσθαι τῆς ἀληθείας. ἔτι γοῦν καὶ μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον τά τε σχήματά μοι τῶν φανέντων ἐν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς παραμένει καὶ ἡ φωνὴ τῶν ἀκουσθέντων **ἔναυλος**· οὕτω **σαφῆ** πάντα ἦν.

To speak after the manner of Homer, ``A divine dream, a vision, came upon me in the ambrosial night,'' so **vivid** as to in no way fall short of the truth. For still, after so much time, the forms of what appeared to me remain in my eyes and the sound of what I heard is **distinct**, everything was so **clear**.
