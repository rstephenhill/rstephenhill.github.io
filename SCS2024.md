3. Xenophon, Memorabilia 2.1.7
- οὐκοῦν εἰτοὺς ἐγκρατεῖς τούτων ἁπάντων εἰς τοὺς ἀρχικοὺς τάττομεν, τοὺς ἀδυνάτους ταῦτα ποιεῖν εἰς τοὺς μηδ᾽ ἀντιποιησομένους τοῦ ἄρχειν τάξομεν; συνέφη καὶ τοῦτο.
- “Therefore if we rankthe ones who are control all these things among those fit to rule, should we rank those who cannot do them among those who don't even make an effort to rule?” He agreed to this too.
